  <h2 id='how-alcohol-damages-cerebellum'>How does Alcohol damage your Cerebellum?</h2>

  <p>Alcohol consumption has a detrimental effect on the motor functions of the cerebellum, in particular postural control and coordination. Damage to the cerebellum can also cause speech control problems and poor muscle coordination. For example, it is very common for patrol officers to check the driver’s ability to perform counting or walking exercises. This is why it is extremely dangerous to drive under the influence of alcohol since it could severely affect your visual and motor skills. </p>
  <p>Brain imaging technology like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that heavy alcohol abuse is correlated to brain tissue shrinkage (significant loss of nerve cells) that could increase the risk of having a stroke. Moreover, long-term alcohol abuse can damage nerve signals that can result in permanent functional deficits in cognitive reasoning and mental balance. For instance, chronic alcoholics might no longer recover their ability to perform smooth and rapid movements as a result of motor control deficits. Abstinence from alcohol may show significant signs of improvement although it depends on how reversible their brain tissue injury is.</p>
  <p>Past research shows how alcoholics perform poorly in visual and cognitive tasks that involve organizing information in the right temporal order. Lack of coordination between visual and motor skills could increase the danger of head injuries and accidental falls. Cerebellar degeneration can provoke severe adaptation issues to changes in visuospatial perception that makes them unable to walk straight or in the dark with their eyes closed.  It can also have a significant impact in the cognitive control of self-movement and sense of position.</p>
  <p>It is still unclear whether instability arising from alcohol abuse is directly caused from cerebellum dysfunction or from deficiency of the peripheral nervous system in body position and motor balance. Hence, more research is still needed to understand whether the cerebellar damage represents the prime cause of certain functional deficits in alcoholics. “New research must be conducted to determine if alcohol-related imbalance results from cerebellar pathology or from poor functioning of the peripheral nervous system in the body’s extremities, such as the hands and feet. Peripheral neuropathy can occur in alcoholics, resulting in decreased sensation that may lead to imbalance ” [<a href='#ref-7'>7</a>]. Knowledge of this kind would be crucial for quickening recovery processes.</p>
