  <p>Damage to the cerebellum can cause a broad spectrum of motor and cognitive disturbances. It causes impairments in motor coordination and balance which lead to symptoms of clumsiness, irregular walking and feelings of dizziness. [1] Smooth and purposeful movements become difficult for subjects with cerebellar damage. [3]</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms can include a wide-based, uncoordinated walk; a back and forth tremor in the trunk of the body; uncoordinated movements of the arms and legs; slow and slurred speech and uncontrolled eye movements. This lack of coordination of motor movements is often referred to as Ataxia. [4] Subjects with left cerebellar damage report attention deficits while right cerebellar damage can lead to disrupted language skills. [1] </p>

  <p>Since the cerebellum plays a role in cognition and emotion, cerebellar dysfunction also contributes to non-motor conditions such as certain neurodevelopmental disorders e.g. autism spectrum disorders. [3] Cerebellar abnormalities have been found in patients with ADHD, which is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Moreover neuroimaging studies show cerebellar differences in subjects with dyslexia. Dyslexic subjects have also shown a poorer performance on a variety of cerebellar motor tasks, which leads to the proposal that cerebellar dysfunction is a core neurobiological underpinning of dyslexia. It was found that early cerebellar damage leads to poorer outcomes than cerebellar damage in adulthood, which suggests that the cerebellum is important during development. [2]</p>

  <p>Cerebellar damage caused by alcoholism specifically is one of the most common acquired forms of cerebellar ataxia.  [5]  The developing cerebellum is very sensitive to the toxic effects of alcohol.  Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, a group of conditions occurring when the mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy show many symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction. [6]</p>
