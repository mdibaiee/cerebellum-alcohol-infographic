  <p>The best treatments for mitigating the effects of alcohol abuse on your body are abstinence, medication, motor and cognitive training and therapeutic counselling. Abstinence from alcohol is the quickest path to recovery as it frees the body of all toxic residues. Abstinence from alcohol may cause intense withdrawal symptoms that can last a few days. Alcoholics normally experience significant signs of improvement on their cognitive tests once the withdrawal period is over. For instance, verbal processing is one of the first areas of cognitive functioning to be fully resumed compared to others (within the first three weeks). The rate of recovery may vary according to various different factors such as the age of the patient or the type of cognitive function required for fulfilling a task. The recovery time for restoring all cognitive functions to normal may vary between weeks, months or even years. In some cases, patients with alcohol addiction may never fully recover their cognitive functions such as multitasking, attention span, decision making, self-restraint, emotion recognition etc. [<a href='#ref-9'>9</a>]</p>
  <p>Recovery may not occur at a regular steady rate, so it is necessary to measure their overall cognitive and motor performance on a regular basis (two times per week for instance). The age of alcohol addicts is a crucial factor for measuring the rate of their recovery processes. In the case of younger alcoholics (40 or under), they will show significant recovery of all cognitive skills except for slight cognitive delays in extremely challenging tasks. Despite showing steady and progressive improvements on their cognitive tests, older alcoholics will nevertheless manifest considerable deficits over a longer time span in problem-solving and visuospatial activities Most research studies suggest that there is no correlation between the alcoholic’s drinking history and the rate of its recovery. Moreover, chronic alcoholics with more than 10 years of heavy drinking are not likely to experience slower recovery processes or more permanent damage to their cognitive systems than those who have no or little drinking history. In this respect, it is important to note how relapse to alcohol addiction after an indefinite period of sobriety is not necessarily contingent on the alcoholic’s drinking history [<a href='#ref-9'>9</a>]</p>

  <p>There is no actual medicine that can cure alcohol-related disorders completely but they can contribute to making alcohol undesirable. For instance, Acamprosate, Disulfiram and Naltrxone are all types of drugs that help reduce the yearning for alcohol as well as prevent the effects of a fall back. To be clear, the taste or smell of alcohol will make the patient feel nauseous and revolting. [<a href='#ref-10'>10</a>, <a href='#ref-11'>11</a>]</p>
  <p>Research conducted from Klintsova and other colleagues measured the ability of rats with alcohol exposure to perform certain motor exercises like rope climbing as part of their motor training program within a period of 6 months. “These results suggest that complex motor skill learning improves some of the motor performance deficits produced by postnatal exposure to alcohol and can potentially serve as a model for rehabilitative intervention” [<a href='#ref-12'>12</a>]. Hence, the effects of motor training on rats could be useful for improving motor skills in patients with cerebellar dysfunction. For example, athletes and musicians with alcohol related cerebellar damage can aim at fully recovering their coordinated movements if they undertake such motor training processes.

  <p>Therapeutic counselling is crucial for regaining the cognitive and motor skills as they were prior to addiction. A counsellor also gives you valuable advice for staying sober in the long run. Alcohol addiction may have a strong impact on your family relations that the patient will need to seek for therapy in a rehab institution. This is why it is important to build a network of close friends that can boost your self-esteem. In this respect, a friendly environment helps the patient face the effects of a possible relapse with greater confidence. There are two types of counselling: in-patient and out-patient. The former is the best form of treatment for the patients that are not able to reduce the levels of alcohol by themselves. They are constantly monitored and guided throughout their rehabilitation. Out-patient rehab is rather meant for those people that have control over their mental health as they show milder symptoms [<a href='#ref-11'>11</a>].</p>
